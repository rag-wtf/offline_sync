Sample Plain Text Document
==========================

This is a plain text file for testing document processing.

Introduction
------------
Plain text files are the simplest form of documents. They contain no formatting,
only raw text characters. This makes them ideal for testing basic text extraction
and processing capabilities.

Content Sections
----------------

Section 1: Lorem Ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Section 2: Technical Information
This document is encoded in UTF-8 format. It contains approximately 1KB of text
data, making it suitable for quick testing and verification of document ingestion
pipelines.

Section 3: Test Data
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter
of the English alphabet and is commonly used for testing text processing systems.

Conclusion
----------
This plain text file serves as a baseline test case for document processing
functionality. It should be successfully parsed and indexed by the RAG system.
